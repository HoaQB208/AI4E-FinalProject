# ‚ú® Training  
Solution use **ML.NET** library.  
+ Select Model Type as **Regression**.  
+ Choose a specific Algorithm or use **AutoML** to automatically find the optimal model.  
+ Optimize the model according to **RMSE**.  
+ After the maximum time allowed, AutoML will choose the **best model** that has been trained.  
+ The model is saved to the **Model.zip** file.  
+ The Model.zip file will be placed on the **Server** and wait for the **Client** to call.
